                <a href="http://www.dowjones.com/">Dow Jones</a> is a news corporation with a suite of products and
                websites that provide financial information and analysis.

                I primarily worked on the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/home-page">Wall Street Journal&apos;s</a>
                website, focusing on charting solutions for the company research portion of the site.
            p.
                I implemented the <a href="http://quotes.wsj.com/NFLX/interactive-chart">interactive chart page</a>
                which allows users to perform technical analysis on securities
                with a highly interactive flash chart. I worked on embedding the flash object on the page and updating
                and implementing the menus that interact with the chart and news articles.
            p.
                I built the <a href="http://quotes.wsj.com/NFLX/research-ratings">Per-Share Earnings, Actuals and
                Estimates</a>
                chart which provides a quick and simple visual representation of a company&apos;s earnings compared to
                estimates.

            p.
                I built the <a href="http://quotes.wsj.com/NFLX/news">News Coverage</a>
                chart which displays the number of news articles over a time period for a security as a bar chart.
            p.
                Finally, I worked on a solution to overlay data points on a stock price chart, and
                fixed bugs for MarketWatch.com and the Wall Street Journal&apos;s website.

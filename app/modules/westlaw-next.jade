                project
                which grew to become one of the largest agile projects in the nation with well over 200 professionals

                I became the primary engineer for several crucial features in WestlawNext.
                I helped architect an extensive XSLT framework to produce the XHTML for legal documents.
                I lead the implementation of document &quot;chunking&quot; to break large documents into smaller parts.
                I also helped build the annotations feature that allows users to highlight sections of documents, and
                add notes to portions of documents that are relevant to their research.
